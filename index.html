It provides users with services for data collection, storage and analysis. Due to its light-weight architecture, high performance and rich feature set together with its deep integration with Apache Hadoop and Spark, Apache IoTDB (incubating) can meet the requirements of massive data storage, high-speed data ingestion and complex data analysis in the IoT industrial fields.</p><h2 class=download-title>Release Version</h2><ul><li style="margin: 5px;">Download IoTDB Binaries: <a href=https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/incubator/iotdb/0.9.0-incubating/apache-iotdb-0.9.0-incubating-bin.zip>IoTDB v0.9.0 Release</a> <span>[<a href=https://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/iotdb/0.9.0-incubating/apache-iotdb-0.9.0-incubating-bin.zip.sha512>SHA512</a>]</span> <span>[<a href=https://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/iotdb/0.9.0-incubating/apache-iotdb-0.9.0-incubating-bin.zip.asc>ASC</a>]</span></li><li style="margin: 5px;">Download IoTDB Sources: <a href=https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/incubator/iotdb/0.9.0-incubating/apache-iotdb-0.9.0-incubating-source-release.zip>IoTDB v0.9.0 Sources</a> <span>[<a href=https://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/iotdb/0.9.0-incubating/apache-iotdb-0.9.0-incubating-source-release.zip.sha512>SHA512</a>]</span> <span>[<a href=https://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/iotdb/0.9.0-incubating/apache-iotdb-0.9.0-incubating-source-release.zip.asc>ASC</a>]</span></li></ul><p>Main features and change list of each version, please check <a href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/incubator-iotdb/release/0.9.0/RELEASE_NOTES.md>release notes</a>.</p><h2 class=download-title>Verifying Hashes and Signatures</h2><p>Along with our releases, we also provide sha512 hashes in *.sha512 files and cryptographic signatures in *.asc files.

Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.<br><span style="font-weight: 500">Copyright Â© 2019 The Apache Software Foundation.
